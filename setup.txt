Make sure you have Python 3 installed. If not, https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install pip3 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587507/how-to-install-pip-with-python-3

Using pip3 create a Python3 virtual environment 

"virtualenv --python=<link/to/python> ./inout"

"source inout/bin/activate"

"pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

You have will have to install punkt and ImageMagick separately. 

For punkt:

Run the python3 shell and do:

"import nltk"
"nltk.download('punkt')"

For ImageMagick:

https://wiki.python.org/moin/ImageMagick

Even after this, you might have a permission issue which can be fixed by editing the config file of ImageMagick

Now you're all set to go!

"python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000" 

Open "localhost:8000" in your browser
